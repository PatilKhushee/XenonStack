E-commerce Project Description:

The E-commerce project is a web application designed to facilitate user registration, login, and interaction with a MySQL database to manage user information. The project is built using Node.js and Express.js for server-side logic, Sequelize as an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for MySQL database interaction, and basic HTML files for front-end views.

Key Features:

User Registration: Users can register with the application by providing a username and password. The registration data is stored in a MySQL database.

User Login: Registered users can log in using their credentials. The application verifies the login information against the data stored in the database.

Static Pages: The project serves static HTML pages for the home page and login form. These pages are displayed based on the corresponding routes in the Express.js application.

Database Integration: Sequelize is used to define a User model, which represents the structure of the "Users" table in the MySQL database. The application interacts with the database to perform user-related operations.

Error Handling: The application includes basic error handling to manage unexpected issues and provide appropriate responses.

Project Structure:

Server: Node.js and Express.js are used to create a server that handles HTTP requests.
Database: MySQL is used as the database management system, and Sequelize is employed for ORM to interact with the database.
Front-end: Basic HTML files are served for the home page and login form.
Middleware: Body-parser middleware is utilized to parse incoming request bodies.
This project provides a foundation for building an e-commerce platform with user authentication and database functionality. You can extend it by adding more features such as product management, shopping cart functionality, and secure payment processing.

But,some errors are occuring in it related to database.
